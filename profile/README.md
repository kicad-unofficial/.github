Welcome,

This organization is a place I created to house my symbol and footprint
libraries for KiCad 6. The intent is to create a set of high-quality 
though non-exhaustive) set of manufacturer-specific symbols and libraries.

Please note, at this point I'm not accepting requests or contributions as I
work on porting my KiCad 5 libraries and establishing some new conventions.
