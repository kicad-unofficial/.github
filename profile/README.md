Welcome,

This organization is a place I created to house my libraries and plugins for
KiCad 6.

My goal is to create a set of high-quality "atomic" part libraries that that do
not require the user to choose footprints or manually add ordering information
to BOM files.

At this point I'm not accepting requests or contributions as I work on porting
across my KiCad 5 libraries and establishing some new conventions. That said, if
you have any questions or are interested in contributing please feel free to
create a GitHub issue under the most appropriate repository.
